# instagram-autoliker
This is a project that I am currently working on. 

The main purpose of the project is to automate the nuance of browsing the instagram. I am trying to use node.js to like the post periodically.

Below is some reference of what I have done:
We can easilly find the API end point [here](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/).
As we can see from the Instagram reference site that the instagram access token is required to use the instagram API. There has been two way to get the access token:

1. [Use your sandbox mode APP](http://jelled.com/instagram/access-token)
2. [Use this site](http://services.chrisriversdesign.com/instagram-token/)

The first optinion is not sufficient, since it is in sandbox mode so we can not access the real world data.
The second optinion is not sufficient for our purpose as well, since it dosen't grant the permission to like other's post. We can only view other's post.

To be continued...
